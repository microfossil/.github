# Microfossil
This github organisation contains repositories of code to help with microfossil and other classification

### particle-trieur 
Particle Trieur is a Java 8 application to help organise and label images. It can use trained models to label images, classifiy using a neural network, sort by similarity, calculate morphology, and train models using the `particle-classification` python library

### particle-classification

Python library for training convolutional neural networks (CNNs) using Tensorflow. Two methods of training are provided, full network training which trains the entire CNN, and transfer learning where only the last few layers are trained and is very fast.
